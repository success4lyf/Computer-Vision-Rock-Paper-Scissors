# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

> In this project, an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game was created, in which the user can play with the computer using the camera.

## Milestone 1

- In this milestone, I used the Google Teachable Machine to create an image project model with four different classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing. Google Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone.

- In the Teachable Machine, I trained images of myself showing the classes to the camera, then I downloaded the model from the Tensorflow tab in Teachable-Machine to my computer for ready to use.
